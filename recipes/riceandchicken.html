    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Fried Rice</h3>
    <p>
        Vegetable pulao, often called ‘vegetable fried rice’, is an 
        easy-to-cook, nutritious recipe. It is a common item on Bengali 
        wedding menus and is often served with fish fry, mutton kosha, or 
        fish kaliya. This fried rice can easily be modified to include 
        seasonal vegetables aside from the peas, beans, and carrots we’ve 
        used here. Long-grained, fragrant Basmati rice is ideal for this 
        preparation. The mark of a good fried rice is long unbroken grains 
        of rice and vibrant, crunchy veggies. In this recipe, we show you 
        techniques to help the vegetable retain their colour and crunch as 
        well as prevent the breakage of cooked rice while mixing.

    <h3>Chilli Chicken</h3>
    <p>
        Chilli chicken is perhaps the most popular Indo-Chinese dish found 
        both in restaurants and street side stalls. No visit to Calcutta’s 
        Chinatowns (especially Tangra) is complete without an order of 
        chilli chicken. The dry chilli chicken works as a snack, appetiser 
        as well as a side. The gravy chilli chicken is more popular as a 
        side to either chowmein or with fried rice. There are various 
        versions of the chilli chicken recipes. While you can play around 
        with the sauces you like in your chilli chicken, most folks will 
        agree that the best chilli chicken has the chicken still crispy 
        when served. With that goal in mind we tested both the wet batter 
        as well as the dry breading technique and finally went with breading. 
        What yielded the crunchiest chicken was Kenji Lopez-Alt’s method 
        which he had used in his <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/the-best-general-tsos-chicken-food-lab-chinese-recipe" alt = "Gen. Tso's Chicken">

    <h2>Method of making Fried Rice</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and boil the rice in a pot full of water until it is 90 
            per cent tender. Drain the water and spread the rice over a 
            colander so that it doesn’t cook any further.</li>
        <li>Dice the carrots in 1-cm cubes. Chop the beans on the bias 
            (in 1-cm sections) for a nice trapezoid shape. Shell the peas.
             Slit the green chillies.</li>
        <li>Freshly grind the peppercorns so that you have about ½ tsp 
            pepper. Mix it with the garam masala powder, salt, and sugar. 
            Combining the spices and seasoning before adding them to the rice 
            will ensure even distribution.</li>
        <li>Set a pan on medium heat and add vegetable oil and ghee to it. 
            Once hot, temper the oil with the bay leaves, cinnamon, 
            cardamom, cloves, and about five peppercorns.</li>
        <li>Add the cashewnuts and fry them until they are lightly coloured. 
            We don’t want them completely golden at this stage as they will fry 
            throughout the cooking process.</li>
        <li>Turn up the heat and add the carrots. Stir-fry them for 2 
            minutes before adding the beans. Fry the beans for 2 minutes
            and then add the peas and raisins. Keeping the heat high 
            ensures that the veggies retain their vibrant colours and don’t 
            lose crunch.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and layer half the cooked rice over the vegetables. 
            Sprinkle half the premixed seasoning. Top off with the remaining rice 
            and seasoning. Also add the green chillies.</li>
        <li>To mix the rice thoroughly while ensuring minimal breakage of 
            the grains, use the fold and rotate motion as shown in the video. 
            Do this until everything is well combined.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan and set it over the lowest heat setting for about 
            20 minutes and steam until the rice has cooked completely. 
            Check once or twice to see that the rice isn’t sticking to the 
            bottom of the pan. Rest for at least 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Method for Preparing Chilli Chicken</h2>
    <h3>Prep the Chicken</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the chicken in 3-cm cubes and set aside.</li>
        <li>Mix together all the ingredients under the 'For the marinade' section. 
            Pour half of this mixture over the chicken cubes, and reserve the other 
            half for use later.</li>
        <li>Coat the chicken well with the marinade, and set it aside to rest 
            for at least 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Make the sauce</h3>
    <ol start="4">
        <li>Meanwhile, prep for the sauce. Cut onions and capsicum in 3-cm squares, chop ginger and garlic 
            finely, and cut green chillies and spring onions on the bias. Keep everything chopped and 
            ready.</li>
        <li>Make a sauce solution by mixing together dark soy, light soy, Chinese cooking wine, vinegar, 
            ketchup, red chilli sauce, salt, pepper, MSG and chicken stock in the proportions given in the
            'For the sauce' section. Keep this mixture ready as well.</li>
        <li>Make a cornflour slurry using ½ tsp cornflour and 1 tsp water. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Now, once the vegetables, sauce mixture and cornflour slurry are ready, heat up your wok. 
            Add 20 g vegetable oil and allow it to smoke. Add dried red chillies, followed by onions and 
            capsicum. Fry on high heat for a minute before adding sugar. Cook the sugar until slightly 
            caremelised (1 minute). This will allow for the creation of the sticky sauce we've come to 
            associate with chilli chicken.</li>
        <li>Next, add ginger and green chillies, and fry for 30 seconds before adding garlic. 
            Then add the sauce solution. When it comes to a boil, add the cornflour slurry. Turn off 
            the heat. We will come back to the sauce later.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Fry the chicken</h3>
    <ol start="9">
        <li>Back to the chicken: To bread the chicken prepare a mixture of cornflour, flour, salt and 
            baking powder in the proportions given in the 'For breading the chicken' section. 
            Now add the remaining half of the marinade we reserved right at the start. Rub it 
            into the flour mixture thoroughly until you it resembles breadcrumbs in texture.</li>
        <li>Now, taking chicken pieces 2 or 3 at a time, coat them in the breading, pressing it down so 
            that it sticks to the chicken. Drop them in oil on medium heat (at roughly 170°C). Fry 
            until golden brown and crisp.</li>
        <li>On an adjoining burner, heat up the sauce again. Drain the chicken from the oil and 
            immediately transfer it to the sauce. Toss to coat. Garnish with spring onions and serve 
            immediately, while the chicken is still crisp.</li>
