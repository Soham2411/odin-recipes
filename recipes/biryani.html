            <li>20 g butter</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <h3>STEP I—FRYING POTATOES</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel potatoes and smear on them yellow food colour. Keep the potatoes<br> whole (each piece should be about 80 g) and go easy on the amount of food colour.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil, 3 cm deep, in a pan. Fry the potatoes until they are lightly<br> coloured on all sides (about 4 minutes).</li>
            <li>Drain them from the oil and set aside.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>STEP II—MAKING BIRISTA</h3>
        <ol start = "4">
            <li>In the same oil, add sliced onions, a small handful at a time, to make birista.</li>
            <li>Weigh two separate portions of birista—20 g and 15 g—and keep ready.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>STEP III—MAKING BIRYANI MASALA</h3>
        <ol start="6">
            <li>In a pan set over medium heat, add all the spices in the given proportions for<br> ‘biryani masala’ (see above). Gently toast them, stirring continuously.</li>
            <li>Transfer the toasted spices to a spice grinder and blitz them to a fine powder.</li>
            <li>Weigh two separate portions of biryani masala—8 g and 5 g— and keep ready.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>STEP IV—MARINATING MUTTON</h3>
        <ol start="9">
            <li>Peel ginger and garlic, roughly chop them, and crush them into a fine paste.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl or pressure cooker, mix together yoghurt, ginger and<br> garlic paste, birista, kewra water, biryani masala, red chilli powder, salt, and<br> ground pepper, in the proportions given above for ‘marinating mutton’.</li>
            <li>Add the mutton pieces and coat them well with the marinade, making sure to to massage it into the crevices too.</li>
            <li>Cover and set aside for 1 hour.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>STEP V—SOAKING RICE</h3>
        <ol start="13">
            <li>Meanwhile, wash the rice and soak it in water for 30 minutes. At the end of<br> this time, drain the water and strain the rice over a net or colander. Set aside.<br> Soaking leads to longer and fluffier rice grains.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>STEP VI—COOKING MUTTON</h3>
        <ol start="14">
            <li>After the mutton has had 1 hour to marinate, transfer it to a pressure cooker.</li>
            <li>Lay the fried potatoes at the bottom of the pressure cooker, followed by the<br> mutton on top (we changed this step from the 
                video because this yields juicier<br> potatoes).</li>
            <li>Add 150 g water and pressure cook it on medium-low heat for 30 minutes.<br> Allow the steam to release naturally for another 
                15 minutes before opening the<br> lid of the pressure cooker.</li>
            <li>Separating mutton, potatoes, and yakhni: Extract the potatoes and mutton pieces<br>
                in separate dishes and set them aside. Now strain the liquid remaining<br> in the pressure cooker. 
                This is called ‘yakhni’ (a broth resulting from mutton<br> and spices cooked together). We need just 200 g of it, so weigh it out and<br> keep ready.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>STEP VII—BOILING WATER FOR RICE</h3>
        <ol start="18">
            <li>Place the spices mentioned in the ‘rice’ section above in the given proportions<br> on a 
                small square of cheesecloth. Tie them with a piece of twine to form a<br> bag.</li>
            <li>In a large pot, take 3 kg water. Add 30 g salt to it.</li>
            <li>Add the bag of spices to the water and allow it to come to a boil (should take<br> about 20 minutes).</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>STEP VIII—PREPARING FOR ASSEMBLY</h3>
        <ol start="21">
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare for assembly by weighing out all that you will need (see<br> ‘assembly’ section above) and keeping ready.</li>
            <li>This is the order in which you will need everything.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Bay leaves</li>
                <li>Cooked mutton pieces</li>
                <li>Cooked potatoes</li>
                <li>Alubukhara</li>
                <li>Birista</li>
                <li>Rose petals (if using)</li>
                <li>Biryani masala</li>
                <li>Grated khoya kheer</li>
                <li>Yakhni</li>
                <li>Lime juice</li>
                <li>Saffron and yellow food colour mixed in 20 g warm milk</li>
                <li>Rose water, kewra water, and meetha attar mixed in 180 g warm milk</li>
                <li>Ghee and butter, melted together in the microwave</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
    <h3>STEP IX—COOKING RICE, ASSEMBLY, AND DUM</h3>
        <ol start="23">
            <li>Set the biryani’r hnari or pan you are using for dum on low heat. Grease it with<br> ghee.</li>
            <li>Lay bay leaves in a single layer to cover the bottom of the pan. These will<br> impart an aroma and provide buffer against burning.</li>
            <li>Place the mutton pieces in a single layer, and the potatoes on top of the<br> mutton. Don’t place potatoes too 
                close to the edge or you might accidentally cut into them while serving.</li>
            <li>Strew alubukhara, birista, and rose petals evenly.</li>
            <li>Take half the stipulated amount of biryani masala and khoya kheer, and spread<br> evenly. We will use the remaining half in the next layer.</li>
            <li>Now add the yakhni and lime juice.</li>
            <li>By this time the water for your rice should have come to a boil and its colour<br> changed. Extract the bag of spices and discard it. 
                Add the rice and let it cook<br> until 80% done, that is, until when the centre is no longer hard, but the grain is<br> still firm. 
                Our rice took about 5 minutes to reach this stage, but read your<br> packet instructions.</li>
            <li>Strain rice, a ladle at a time, and spread it directly in the pan. Repeat this until half the rice is added to the pan.</li>
            <li>On top of this first layer of rice, spread the remaining biryani masala and khoya kheer. Also spread the saffron+colour mixture evenly.</li>
            <li>Now strain the rest of the rice and add it to the pan. Flatten it gently.</li>
            <li>On top of the second layer of rice, add milk mixed with the aromatics. Also<br> add melted butter and ghee, making sure to drizzle it 
                near the sides of the pan<br> too.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan with heavy-duty aluminium foil (if yours is thin, use double<br> layers), sealing the sides well so that no steam escapes. Cover 
                the pan with a<br> tight-fitting lid. If you don’t want to use foil, you can also seal the lid with a wet<br> flour dough.</li>
            <li>Set the pan on dum on medium-low heat for 30 minutes. Turn of the heat and<br> allow it to rest another 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
